# SCP CB Room sample for Blender modelling

I left it here for 3D modellers, who want to create High Quality rooms in Blender (or other modelling software) for SCP games (who want to use CB's map style).

CBRoom folder contains room samples with CB size * 0.01.

Standartized_CBroom folder contains room samples with CB_size * 0.01 * 0.9765 (which equals size like ~ 1 m x 1 m in Blender)

These models are free to use.
