# SCP: Secret Laboratory assets
## Folder structure
Non_official_CCBYSA3/ is unofficial, but still CC-BY-SA 3.0 assets (read next paragraph about usage)
Official_CCBYSA4/ is official assets, licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0

### Regarding non-official assets:
I asked a question about asset license in SCP:SL official discord server, and received answer by a moderator (a Northwood staff), that assets, created by Northwood, are licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.

Also Hubert Moszka (in HCZ Nuke room creation stream), also confirmed, that SCP:SL assets are CC-BY-SA.
