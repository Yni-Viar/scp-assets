# SCP: Secret Laboratory assets
## Folder structure
/CCBYSA3/ is unofficial, but still CC-BY-SA 3.0 assets (as mentioned in Update 2025.04.26)
/CCBYSA4/ is official assets, licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0

## Old question
- Q: Why only HCZ textures and 14.0 human models are included?
- A: Because there are only officialy released assets, alongside with soundtrack.
    - About other assets (including community Blender ports): The license states that "majority of assets are CC-BY-SA", but it does not specify, which assets falls under this license.

### Update 2025.04.26:
I asked a question about asset license in SCP:SL official discord server, and received answer by a moderator (a Northwood staff), that assets, created by Northwood, are licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.

That means, some SCP: Secret Lab assets would be uploaded soon.
