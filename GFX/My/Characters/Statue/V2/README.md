# About
- Recently, I found the problem of CC-BY-SA - it is indeterminate in "Share Alike problem"
- On the one hand CC-BY-SA applies only on original or changed asset, including inclusions in other asset. E.g. the picture, where SCP: Unity's SCP-173 stands in the front IS licensed under CC-BY-SA.
- On the other hand it can act as AGPL for software (and this indetermination led to prohibition to use this license in Unreal Engine) - depending what is "derivative" asset...
- I decided, that this model will have CC-BY license instead of CC-BY-SA.
- But what's about SCP?
- If you remember, "Untitled 2004", the original SCP-173 statue, wasn't an SCP originally. And this model can be SCP-173 or to be a usual concrete statue.
