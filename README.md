 My collection of SCP Assets (and more)

General information
---

License: CC-BY-SA 3.0 for SCP - Containment Breach assets (currently it is only SCP-079), CC-BY-SA 3.0 with SCP-Wiki exception (for SCP: Unity assets), CC-BY-SA 4.0 (for SCP: Secret Laboratory assets and my own SCP themed assets) and CC-BY 4.0 (for my own non-SCP assets)
Check LICENSE and README files, placed in the folder for more detail for the usage

For SCP-Containment Breach rooms, check the git history (click on Commits button if you are using web interface) and download the archive.
I removed them, because of possible licensing issues (I don't know about rooms, but for example, SCP-1499 model is from FPS Creator,
which may violate the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license, as stated both in SCP-Containment Breach and SCP Foundation wiki)

---
Regarding SCP: Secret Laboratory unofficial assets (which had only old HCZ rooms):

I removed it from the repo (it may stay in Git history, but I do NOT recommend doing this), because they:
1. Are not official, but extracted from the game.
2. Their CC-BY-SA license *may* or *may not* apply on it -> resulting in possible licensing issues (see SCP:SL EULA).

---
I have credited authors where it was possible, in other cases,
these assets are from the SCP - Containment Breach, SCP Unity and SCP: Secret Laboratory.
